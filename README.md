# sales-data-analysis
 Note:    I explained this analysis to a group in a public platform, and one professional pointed out that I have made a mistake in slopes. It turns out that when a slope is too small, one must not analyse it further quantitaively, better try to treat it as a horizontal line(There are exceptions though).
